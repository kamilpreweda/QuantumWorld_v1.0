This is my first big learning project. I wanted to learn about WPF and Model-View-ViewModel pattern. I didn't like it.
I know that it's terrible, but I learned a lot. There were hundreds of problems. (it's still unfinished - and probably won't be ever)

The project idea was to simulate (in a simple way) a browser game - Ogame. (I played like 15 years ago, good times)

I had to find out, among other things:
- how to change views in the same window
- how to create countdown timer that will be displayed on screen while building was in construction
- how to create a battle algorithm to take down enemies
- how to create models
- how to build multiple ships at once
- how to implement validation for buttons
- how binding works
- how XAML works
- how to add images to the project
- how to use Commands
- how to display changes on screen
- how to constantly increase player's resources in time
- and so many more

Since it was my own idea, the solutions were not so easy to find.

It's not looking great but it was a huge amount of information, and I struggled a lot. I guess that the most important thing I learned from this project is that every problem can be solved in some way given enough time.

P.S.

The second most important thing I learned is that I like web applications much more.
